Notes

- Red circle came out oblong due to dividing pixel delta by an int not float
- Creating solutions around the abstract base hittable and sphere concrete classes - just implement sphere for now as I don't need the expansion functionality of the base class, also c.
- First larger project using procedural code, used to using OOP with Python.
