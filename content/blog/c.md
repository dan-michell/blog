_This page will be updated over time as I progress in learning C._

# why c?

I wanted a challenge, to learn something which is difficult. For me, learning hard things makes understanding new problems less daunting, knowing I have solved relatively harder in the past. Also, having studied computer science at A level and not really grasped many of the concepts, I wanted redemption. Learning C would take me there. Making me no longer take for granted the many abstracted list methods I use daily in Python and pushing me to understand the DS&A that powers these.

# learning plan

I'm starting from the basics, having written 0 lines of C code in my life, I want to take it slowly and make sure I properly understand each concept. I find I lose motivation when I rush through the learning phase too quickly only to find myself way out of my depth and thinking - 'guess this isn't for me'.

This is the rough plan I will follow:

- **Complete CS50** - The first term of Harvard's computer science course. Uses C to introduce basic data structures and algorithms along with covering a lot of fundamental syntax. Has multiple problems to solve after each lecture to avoid falling into tutorial hell.
- **Read C Programming: A Modern Approach by K. N. King** - Recommended by many who have gone through the process of learning the language. Covers all aspects of the language in a very approachable manor. Will also allow me to test my recall of the concepts covered over CS50.
- **Graphics** - During my Mech. Eng. studies matrices and vectors were used throughout, and I enjoyed solving this type of problem a lot. To scratch that itch and also make something pretty appear on my screen I want to give graphics programming a shot. C has had a large part to play in graphics development, while still being relevant today resulting in many resources available. I probably won't wait until all the reading is done before messing around with this.
